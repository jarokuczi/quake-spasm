## QuaqeSpasm 

This is a port for AmigaOS4 

To build it you need to have ogles2, gl4es and sdl2 libraries.

This is still a work in progress, it has a lot of bugs, crashes very often and things don't look right.

The original readme is here: https://github.com/jarokuczi/quake-spasm/blob/master/Quakespasm.txt

All credit goes to people working on Quake Spasm and the libraries used to make it work.
